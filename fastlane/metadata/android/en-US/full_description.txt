<p><i>Photon</i> is a cross-platform file-transfer application. It uses http to transfer files between devices.You can transfer files between devices that run Photon. No wifi router is required, you can use hotspot.</p><p>Features include e.g.:</p><ul><li><b>Cross-platform support:</b> For instance you can transfer files between Android and Windows</li><li><b>Transfer multiple files:</b>You can pick any number of files.</li><li><b>Pick files faster:</b> Most of the apps use file_picker for picking the files. But for android it caches files before retrieving the paths. If the file size is large it will result in considerable amount of delay. So I have tweaked file_picker to avoid caching(android) unless it is required (some files need to be cached). No matter how many files are selected ,paths will be retrieved within no time. (Note:Caching issue is android specific)</li><li><b>Smooth UI:</b> Material You design.</li><li>Works between the devices connected via mobile-hotspot / between the devices connected to same router (same local area network)</li><li><b>Uses cryptographically secure secret code generation for authentication (internally):</b> Even though the files are streamed at local area network,files cannot be downloaded/received without using Photon. No external client like browser can get the files using url,as secret code is associated with url. It will be regenerated for every session.</li><li><b>Supports high-speed data transfer:</b> Photon is capable of transferring files at a very high rate but it depends upon the wifi bandwidth. (No internet connection required)</li></ul>
